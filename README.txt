🚀 Overview

Find My City is an interactive recommendation tool that analyzes a user’s preferences (cost of living, weather, safety, culture, and more) and matches them with ideal cities across the U.S. or globally.

The goal is to combine real data + subjective vibe scoring to create a personalized city discovery experience.

This project is built as a collaborative learning experience and may evolve into a full product.
